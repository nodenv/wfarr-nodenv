## Credits

Forked from [@wfarr](https://github.com/wfarr) as he wasn't keeping up with pull requests.

This library was heavily, heavily, heavily inspired by
[@sstephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson)'s
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) projects.
A few ideas were also taken from [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

A number of patterns and utilities are borrowed from that project,
and it is my hope that nodenv provides the same simplicity,
elegance, and usability that I've come to love in rbenv and ruby-build
for NodeJS users.
